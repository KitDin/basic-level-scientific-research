Yet despite all the public <b><u>adulation</u></b>, Henry stirs up no envy or resentment among the 2000 students – in fact, they all adore him. The dog, who first arrived six months ago, is a super dog, who has improved students\' behaviour and encouraged more students to focus on their academic achievement.<br>  Andrew Wainwright, a student at Dronfield School, says there is something magical and calming about being able to interact with Henry during his time at the school\'s catch-up classes, and that if he falls behind, that opportunity will be denied. Even doubting staff have finally been won round. Perhaps that is because Henry, who lies on the floor during staff meetings, has also had a calming effect on them.<br>  It was Andrew\'s teacher, Wendy Brown and the school counsellor, Julie Smart, who first proposed buying a school dog. "Julie and I were talking one day about how looking after dogs can positively affect children\'s conduct," says Brown. "We did some research and discovered that the presence of pets has been shown to be therapeutic. A number of studies have shown that animals improve recovery after surgery or illness and have a calming influence on people in a lot of settings. Some of my kids can be a <b><u>handful</u></b> and some of the children Julie counsels have terrible problems."<br>    Could the school dog become a craze? Other schools such as the Mulberry Bush, a primary school or children with behavioural problems, have stepped forward to point out they already have <b><u>one</u></b>. Rosie Johnston, a Mulberry staff member has been bringing her golden retriever, Muskoka, into school for three years. Apart from being a calming influence, Muskoka even plays his part in literacy lessons. Children at the school can be too shy to read to adults so they read to Muskoka. "Their anxiety about mispronouncing something or getting the words in the wrong order is reduced when they read to him," says Johnston.<br>  Psychologist Dr Deborah Wells from Queen\'s University Belfast specialises in animal-human interaction. She believes that the underlying key to the Henry effect is that dogs offer unconditional love and that cheers up adults and children and helps with self-esteem. But traditionalist Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools says, "I don\'t see why a teacher cannot create a positive learning environment through the subject they teach and their personality. Dogs strike me as a bit of a publicity stunt. It\'s the kind of sentimental story journalists love." Despite this sentiment, Henry remains as popular as ever.',

Millions of tons of computers, TVs, smartphones, and other equipment are discarded each year. In most countries, all this waste ends up in landfills, where it poisons the environment – e-waste contains many toxic substances such as lead, mercury, and arsenic that leak into the ground.<br> Recycling is the ideal solution to the problem. E-waste contains significant amounts of valuable metals like gold and silver that make it attractive to recycle. In theory, recycling gold from old computers is more efficient - and lesss environmentally destructive - than digging it from the earth. The problem is that a large percentage of e-waste dropped off for recycling in wealthy countries is sold and diverted to the developing world, posing an increasing threat to the health of the people there.<br> To address the problem of the international trade in e-waste, 170 nations signed the 1989 Basel Convention, an agreement requiring that developed nations <b><u>notify</u></b> developing nations of hazardous waste shipments coming to their countries. Then, in 1995 the Basel Convention was modified to ban hazardous waste shipments to poor countries completely.

Although this is only a fraction of the total, it wouldn\'t take many more machines like this to process the entire USA\'s output of high-tech trash.<br> Unfortunately, under current policies, domestic processing of e-waase is not compulsory, and while shipping waste abroad is ethically questionable, it is still more profitable than processing it safely in the USA.

One egg yolk, in fact, contains a little more than two-thirds of the suggested daily cholesterol limit. This knowledge has driven egg sales to plummet in recent years, which in turn has brought about the development of several alternatives to eating regular eggs. One alternative is to eat substitute eggs. These eggs substitutes are not really eggs, but they look somewhat like eggs when they are cooked. They have the advantage of having low cholesterol rates, and they can be scrambled or used in baking. One disadvantage, however, is that they are not good for frying, poaching, or boiling. A second alternative to regular eggs is a new type of egg, sometimes called "designer" eggs. These eggs are produced by hens that are fed low-flat diets consisting of ingredients such as canola oil, flax, and rice bran. In spite of their diet, however, these hens produce eggs that contain the same amount of cholesterol as regular eggs. Yet, the producers of these eggs claim that eating their eggs will not raise the blood cholesterol in humans. <br> Eggs producers claim that their product has been portrayed unfairly. They cite scientific studies to back up their claim. And, in fact, studies on the relationship between eggs and human cholesterol levels have brought mixed results. It may be that is not the type of eggs that is the main determinant of cholesterol but the person who is eating the eggs. Some people may be more sensitive to cholesterol derived from food than other people. In fact, there is evidence that certainly dietary fats stimulate the body\'s production of blood cholesterol. Consequently, while it still makes sense to limit one\'s intake of eggs, even designer eggs, it seems that doing this without regulating dietary fat will probably not help reduce the blood cholesterol level.',

He traveled extensively and used the knowledge gained during his travels as the basis for his early novels. In 1837, at the age of eighteen, Melville slimed as a cabin boy on a merchant ship that was to sail from his Massachusetts home to Liverpool, England. His experiences on this trip served as a <u>basis</u> for the novel Redburn (1849). In 1841 Melville set out on a whaling ship headed for the South Seas. After jumping ship in Tahiti, he wandered around the islands of Tahiti and Moorea. This South Sea island sojourn was a backdrop to the novel Omoo (1847). After three years away from home, Melville joined up with a U.S. naval frigate that was returning to the eastern United States around Cape Horn. The novel White-Jacket (1850) describes this lengthy voyage as a navy seaman. With the publication of these early adventure novels, Melville developed a strong and loyal following among readers eager for his tales of exotic places and situations. However, in 1851, with the publication of Moby Dick, Melville\'s popularity started to diminish. Moby Dick, on one level the saga of the hunt for the great white whale, was also a heavily symbolic allegory of the heroic struggle of humanity against the universe. The public was not ready for Melville\'s literary <u>metamorphosis</u> from romantic adventure to philosophical symbolism. It is ironic that the novel that served to diminish Melville\'s popularity during his lifetime is the one for which he is best known today.',

Under such conditions, Mandan women had to grow maize capable of weathering adversity.<br> They began as early as it appeared feasible to do so in the spring, clearing the land, using fire to clear stubble from the fields and then planting.

The distinction was a prominent feature of early theories describing the phases of matter. In the nineteenth century, for example, one theory maintained that a liquid could be "dissolved" in a vapor without losing its identity, and another theory held that the two phases are made up of different kinds of molecules: liquidons and gasons.

It winds counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere as it is described for the term, cyclone itself. This powerful storm is fueled by the heat energy that is released when water vapor condenses at high altitudes, the heat ultimately derived from the Sun.<br> The center of a tropical cyclone, called the eye, is relatively calm and warm. This eye, which is roughly 20 to 30 miles wide, is clear, mainly because of subsiding air within it. The ring of clouds around the eye is the eyewall, where clouds reach highest and precipitation is heaviest. The strong wind, gusting up to 360 kilometers per hour, occurs when a tropical cyclone\'s eyewall passes over land.<br> There are various names for a tropical cyclone depending on its location and strength. In Asia, a tropical cyclone is named according to its strength. The strongest is a typhoon; its winds move at more than 117 kilometers per hour. In India, it is called a cyclone. Over the North Atlantic and in the South Pacific, they call it a hurricane.<br> On average, there are about 100 tropical cyclones worldwide each year. A tropical cyclone peaks in late summer when the difference between temperature in the air and sea surface is the greatest. However, it has its own seasonal patterns. May is the least active month, while September is the most active.<br> The destruction associated with a tropical cyclone results not only from the force of the wind, but also from the storm surge and the waves <b><u>it</u></b> generates. It is born and sustained over large bodies of warm water, and loses its strength over inland regions that are comparatively safe from receiving strong winds. Although the tract of a tropical cyclone is very <b><u>erratic</u></b>, the Weather Service can still issue timely warnings to the public if a tropical cyclone is approaching densely populated areas. If people ever experience a cyclone, they would know how strong it could be.',

The frontier had mostly disappeared and by 1910 most Americans lived in towns and cities. Industrialization and the bureaucratization of economic life combined with a new emphasis upon credentials and expertise to make schooling increasingly important for economic and social mobility. Increasingly, too, schools were viewed as the most important <b><u>means</u></b> of integrating immigrants into American society.<br> arrival of a great wave of southern and eastern European immigrants at the turn of the century <b><u>coincided with</u></b> and contributed to an enormous expansion of formal schooling. By 1920 schooling to age fourteen or beyond was compulsory in most states, and the school year was greatly lengthened. Kindergartens, vacation schools, extracurricular activities, and vocational education and counseling extended the influence of public schools over the lives of students, many of whom in the larger industrial cities were the children of immigrants. Classes for adult immigrants were sponsored by public schools, corporations, unions, churches, settlement houses, and other agencies.<br> Reformers early in the twentieth century suggested that education programs should suit the needs of specific populations. Immigrant women were once such population. Schools tried to educate young women so they could occupy productive places in the urban industrial economy, and one place many educators considered appropriate for women was the home.<br> Although looking after the house and family was familiar to immigrant women, American education gave homemaking a new definition. In preindustrial economies, homemaking had meant the production as well as the consumption of goods, and <b><u>it</u></b> commonly included income-producing activities both inside and outside the home, in the highly industrialized early-twentieth-century United States, however, overproduction rather than scarcity was becoming a problem. Thus, the ideal American homemaker was viewed as a consumer rather than a producer. Schools trained women to be consumer homemakers cooking, shopping, decorating, and caring for children "efficiently" in their own homes, or if economic necessity demanded, as employees in the homes of others. Subsequent reforms have made these notions seem quite out-of-date.',

The husband earned the mo ney for the family. He was usually out working all day. He came home tired in the evening, so he did not do much housework. And he did not see the children very much, except on weekends.<br> These days, however, more and more women work outside the home. They cannot stay with the children all day. They, too, come home tired in the evening. They do not want to spend the evening cooking dinner and cleaning up. They do not have time to clean the house and do the <b><u>laundry</u></b>. So who is going to do the housework now? Who is going to take care of the children? <br> Many families solve the problem of housework by sharing it. In these families, the husband and wife agree to do different jobs around the house, or they take turns doing each job. For example, the husband always cooks dinner and the wife always does the laundry. Or the wife cooks dinner on some nights and the husband cooks dinner on other nights. <br> Then there is the question of the children. In the past, many families got help with child care from grandparents. Now families usually do not live near their relatives. The grandparents are often too far away to help in a regular way. More often, parents have to pay for child care help. The help may be a babysitter or a day-care center. The problem with t his kind of help is the high cost. It is possible only for couples with jobs that pay well. <br> Parents may get another kind of help form the companies they work for. Many companies now let people with children work part-time. That way, parents can spend mo re time with their children. Some husbands may even stop working for a while to stay with the children. For these men there is a new word: <b><u>they</u></b> are called "househusbands". In the USA more and more men are becoming househusbands every year. <br> These changes in the home mean changes in the family. Fathers can learn to understand their children better, and the children can get to know their fathers better. Husbands and wives may also find changes in their marriage. They, too, may have a better understanding of each other.',

A little thought, however, will show w hy speech is primary and writing secondary to language. Human beings have been writing (as far as we can tell from surviving evidence) for at least 5000 years; but they have been talking for much longer, doubtless ever since there have been human beings. <br> When writing did develop, it was derived from and represented speech, although imperfectly. Even today there are spoken languages that have no written form. Furthermore, we all learn to talk well before we learn to write; any human child who is not severely handicapped physically or mentally will learn to talk: a normal human being cannot be prevented from doing so. On the other hand, it takes a special effort to learn to write. In the past many intelligent and useful members of society did not acquire the skill, and even today many who speak languages with writing systems never learn to read or write, while some who learn the rudiments of those skills do so only imperfectly. <br> To affirm the primacy of speech over writing is not, however, to disparage the latter. One <b><u>advantage</u></b> writing has over speech is that it is more permanent and makes possible the records that any civilization must have.

                'content' => 'In the world today, particularly in the two most industrialized areas, North America and Europe, recycling is big news. People are talking about it, practicing it, and discovering new ways to be sensitive to the environment. Recycling means finding was to use products a second time. The motto of the recycling movement is "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle". <br> The first step is to reduce garbage. In stores, a shopper has to buy products in blister packs, boxes and expensive plastic wrappings. A hamburger from a fast food restaurant comes  in lots of packaging: usually paper, a box, and a bag. All that packaging is wasted resources.  People should try to buy things that are wrapped simply, and to reuse cups and utensils.  Another way to reduce waste is to buy high- quality products. When low quality appliances  break, many customers throw them away and buy new ones - a loss of more resources and  more energy. For example, if a customer buys a high-quality appliance that can be easily  repaired, the manufacturer receives an important message. In the same way, if a customer  chooses a product with less packaging, that customer sends an important message to the  manufacturers. To reduce garbage, the throwaway must stop.<br> The second step is to reuse. It is better to buy juices and soft drinks in returnable bottles.  After customers empty the bottles, they return them to the store. The manufacturers of  the drinks collect the bottles, wash them, and then fill them again. The energy that is necessary to  make new bottles is saved. In some parts of the world, returning bottles for money is a  common practice. In those places, the garbage dumps have relatively little glass and plastic  from throwaway bottles.<br> The third step is being environmentally sensitive is to recycle. Spent motor oil can be  cleaned and used again. Aluminum cans are expensive to make. It takes the same amount of energy to make one aluminum can as it does to run a color TV set for three hours. When people collect and recycle aluminum (for new cans), they help save one of the world\'s precious resources.',

                'content' => 'An air pollutant is defined as a compound added directly or indirectly by humans to the atmosphere in such quantities as to affect humans, animals, vegetation, or materials adversely. Air pollution requires a very flexible definition that permits continuous change. When the first air pollution laws were established in England in the fourteenth century, air pollutants were limited to compounds that could be seen or smelled - a far cry from the extensive list of harmful substances known today. As technology has developed and knowledge of the health aspects of various chemicals has increased, the list of air pollutants has lengthened. In the future, even water vapor might be considered an air pollutant under certain conditions.<br> Many of the more important air pollutants, such as sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides, are found in nature. As the Earth developed, the concentration of these pollutants was altered by various chemical reactions; they became components in biogeochemical cycles. These serve as an air purification scheme by allowing the compounds to move from the air to the water or soil. On a global basis, nature\'s output of these compounds dwarfs that resulting from human activities. <br> However, human production usually occurs in a <b>localized</b> area, such as a city. In such a region, human output may be dominant and may temporarily overload the natural purification scheme of the cycles. The result is an increased concentration of noxious chemicals in the air. The concentrations at which the adverse effects appear will be greater than the concentrations that the pollutants would have in the absence of human activities. The actual concentration need not be large for a substance to be a pollutant; in fact, the numerical value tells us little until we know how much of an increase this represents over the concentration that would occur naturally in the area. For example, sulfur dioxide has <b>detectable</b> health effects at 0.08 parts per million (ppm), which is about 400 times its natural level. Carbon monoxide, however, has a natural level of 0.1 ppm and is not usually a pollutant until its level reaches about 15 ppm.',

It all began with e-mail, online chat rooms, and games. Then step by step young people made sentences, phrases and words shorter. As text-messaging continued to become popular, people invented more and more words. Today, it is like a real language with its own grammar and vocabulary. The growth of text-messaging has raised an important question: As students become fluent in text­messaging, do their writing skills suffer? People have different ideas about the effects of text-messaging on students\' writing skills. Some say that students are losing the ability to write long, correct sentences. Others say that text-messaging is having a good effect on the language students use in then schoolwork. It shows that they are creative and good at expressing themselves. And if students can keep the two systems separate - one for text­-messaging and one for school - this will help students appreciate reading and writing more. Some people suggest that one way to reduce the bad effects of text-messaging is to find ways to use technology as a positive learning tool. For example, students can be allowed to type their assignments in a cell phone message and send them to their teachers, but they must type correctly. In this way, students are using the technology that they are familiar with to communicate in a form of language suitable for schoolwork.
